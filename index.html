              <h3>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie</h3>
              Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, <br>
              a longtime Bell Labs scientist and co-author of The Design of Switching Circuits<br>
              on switching circuit theory.<br><br>

              As a child, Dennis moved with his family to Summit, New Jersey, where he graduated<br>
              from Summit High School.He graduated from Harvard University with degrees in physics<br>
              and applied mathematics in 1963.<br><br>


              In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center. <br>
              In 1968, he defended his PhD thesis on "Computational Complexity and Program Structure"<br>
              at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially<br>
              received his PhD degree as he did not submit a bound copy of his dissertation to the Harvard library,<br>
              a requirement for the degree.<br>
              In 2020, the Computer History Museum worked with Ritchie's family and Fischer's family and found <br>
              a copy of the lost dissertation.<br><br>
